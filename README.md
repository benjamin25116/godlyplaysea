This was a project I did while going through FreeCodeCamp's 12 hour tutorial on basic HTML and CSS. It's a fictional website for a church project. 

I put it together while learning various concepts. As I learnt something new, I'd go back and try it out on this project. Also, I realise that the CSS is extremely bloated because I styled each element individually. I realise this isn't maintainable and good coding. 

I hope to redo this project after learning some JavaScript and more CSS best-practices.
